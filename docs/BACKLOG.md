# Delta-V Backlog

Active work items are listed below in one global priority order.

Use this file for unfinished actionable work only. Do not duplicate shipped history, recurring review procedures, or long-form architecture rationale here; keep those in git history, [REVIEW_PLAN.md](./REVIEW_PLAN.md), and [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) respectively.

## Active work

### 1. Complete supply-chain release review

**Source:** [REVIEW_PLAN.md](./REVIEW_PLAN.md) section 7 follow-up.

Run networked `npm audit` and `npm outdated`, then either clear the review as `pass` or document accepted risk / concrete upgrade work here.

**Files / commands:** `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.nvmrc`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `npm audit`, `npm outdated`

## Future features (not currently planned)

These items are potential future work that depend on product decisions or external triggers. They are not in the active queue.

### Public matchmaking with longer room identifiers

**Trigger:** product moves beyond shared short codes.

Implement longer opaque room IDs or signed invites and update the join/share UX accordingly.

**Files:** `src/server/protocol.ts`, lobby and join UI, share-link format

### Trusted HTML sanitizer for user-controlled markup

**Trigger:** chat, player names, or modded scenarios render as HTML.

Add a single sanitizer boundary (e.g. DOMPurify inside `dom.ts`) and route all user-controlled markup through it. The trusted HTML boundary (`setTrustedHTML`) already exists for internal strings.

**Files:** `src/client/dom.ts`, client call sites, optional dependency add

### WAF or Cloudflare rate limits for join/replay probes

**Trigger:** distributed scans wake durable objects or cost too much.

Baseline per-isolate rate limiting is already shipped (100 combined GET /join + /replay per 60s per IP). Add WAF or `[[ratelimits]]` only if the baseline proves insufficient.

**Files:** `wrangler.toml`, Cloudflare dashboard, `src/server/index.ts`
